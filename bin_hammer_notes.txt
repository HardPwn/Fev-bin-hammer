Here is the detailed sequence diagram using Mermaid syntax:The sequence diagram represents the interactions between the various functions and components in the provided code. Here's a breakdown of the key interactions:
1. The cli module acts as the entry point, invoking the different functions based on the user's choice.
2. The function1 module calls the print_file_size function to print the file size and then calls the Repeat function to allow the user to select another operation.
3. The function2 module calls the read_file function to read the contents of the input file and then calls the Repeat function.
4. The function3 module calls the detect_arch function to detect the architecture of the input file and then calls the Repeat function.
5. The function4 module calls the file_extension_to_input_format and output_format_to_output_extension functions to determine the input and output formats, respectively. It then calls the run_objcopy function to perform the file conversion and finally calls the Repeat function.
6. The function5 module calls the run_binwalk function to perform an entropy check on the input file and then calls the Repeat function.
7. The function6 module calls the generate_radare2_command function to generate the Radare2 command and then calls the run_radare2 function to perform the disassembly. It then calls the Repeat function.
8. The function7 module calls the extract_strings function to extract the printable strings from the input file and then calls the Repeat function.
9. The function8 module calls the generate_radare2_command and run_radare2 functions to perform the decompilation and then calls the Repeat function.
10. The function9 module calls the analyze_crypto function to analyze the input file for any cryptographic operations and then calls the Repeat function.
11. The function10 module calls the run_emba function to perform the decompilation and report generation, including CVE scanning. It then calls the cve_checker function to analyze the CVE report and finally calls the Repeat function.
12. The function11 module calls the file_compare function to compare two binary files and then calls the Repeat function.
13. The function12 module calls the print_subchoices1 function to display the firmware unpacking options, then calls the fmk function to perform the firmware extraction, and finally calls the Repeat function.
14. The function13 module calls the firmware_repack function to repack the firmware and then calls the Repeat function.
The sequence diagram provides a comprehensive overview of the interactions between the various components and functions, making it easier to understand the overall system behavior and the flow of execution.
